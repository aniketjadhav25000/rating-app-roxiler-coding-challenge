# Roxiler Systems Coding Challenge: [Your Rating App Name]

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for the **Roxiler Systems Coding Challenge**.

The project is a **[Briefly describe your application, e.g., "full-stack web application for rating and reviewing products/services"]**. It demonstrates competence in building a [Frontend Framework/Backend Framework] application with robust database management using PostgreSQL.

### Key Features

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login and distinct roles (User and Admin).
* **[Core Feature 1, e.g., Product Listing & Search]:** Dynamic display of items with filtering capabilities.
* **[Core Feature 2, e.g., Rating Submission]:** Users can submit a rating (e.g., 1-5 stars) and a written review.
* **[Core Feature 3, e.g., Admin Dashboard]:** A dedicated section for administrators to manage content and users.

## üíª Tech Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

| Category | Technology | Version / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | [Your Framework] | [e.g., React, Vue, Angular] + [e.g., CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS] |
| **Backend** | [Your Framework/Language] | [e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, Java with Spring Boot] |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** (Managed via pgAdmin) | Robust, open-source object-relational database. |
| **State Management** | [e.g., Redux, Zustand, React Context] | Used for efficient state handling. |
| **Deployment/Hosting** | [e.g., Vercel, Heroku, AWS] | *[Optional: Mention if deployed]* |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js (LTS version)
* [Your Backend Language/Runtime, e.g., Python, Java]
* **PostgreSQL** (Database Server)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repo Folder Name]
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend/

    # Install dependencies
    npm install  # or yarn install, pip install -r requirements.txt, etc.

    # Configure environment variables (e.g., .env file)
    # Ensure DATABASE_URL is set correctly for your PostgreSQL instance.
    ```

3.  **Database Setup:**
    * Start your PostgreSQL server.
    * Create a database named `[Your Database Name, e.g., roxiler_ratings]`.
    * Run migrations to set up the tables:
        ```bash
        # Command to run migrations (e.g., for Express/Knex)
        npm run migrate
        ```
    * Run seed files to populate initial data:
        ```bash
        # Command to run seed files (e.g., an initial Admin user)
        npm run seed
        ```

4.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate back to the root, then into the frontend directory
    cd ../frontend/

    # Install dependencies
    npm install # or yarn install

    # Configure API endpoint (e.g., .env file)
    # Ensure VITE_API_URL or similar is pointing to your local backend server.
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend/
    npm start # or python manage.py runserver, etc.
    # The server will run on [e.g., http://localhost:5000]
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend/
    npm run dev # or npm start
    # The app will open in your browser on [e.g., http://localhost:3000]
    ```

| **Ratings** | Full | Can submit, edit, and delete their own ratings/reviews. |
| **Products** | View Only | Can browse all products and see aggregated scores. |

### **2. Administrator (Admin)**

| Feature | Access | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login ID** | `admin@roxiler.com` *(Check seed file for exact initial credentials)* | |
| **Dashboard** | Full Access | Centralized panel to manage all data. |
| **Users** | Full | Can view, deactivate, and delete user accounts. |
| **Content** | Full | Can delete or edit any submitted ratings/reviews. |

### **Initial Admin Credentials**

| Credential | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Admin Login ID** | `[Your Seeded Admin Email/Username]` |
| **Admin Password** | `[Your Seeded Admin Password]` |
| **Note** | *These credentials are created via the database seed file (`[path to seed file]`) and should be changed immediately after the first login.* |
